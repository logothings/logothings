# Contribute

We are using Github issues and git pull-requests for managing
contributions to this website.

## Github Issues

A [Guide to Github issuse](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
is available for those of you new to Github. The gist of the process is:

* click on the [Issues](https://github.com/logothings/logothings/issues) tab of the [logothings](https://github.com/logothings/logothings) repository;
* scan the current set of open issues to ensure that your contribution does not conflict with another contribution in progress;
* click on the bright green [New issue](https://github.com/logothings/logothings/issues/new) button;
* create you issue, upload or include links to any content you may want to add to the site (Videos should be uploaded to *YouTube* or some other hosting site and a link provided here);
* be sure to indicate where you want to add your contribution and under what license the contribution will be made (We cannot accept any proprietary content on this website);
* while editing your issue, add the *Contribution* label by clicking on the *Labels* button on the right side of the screen.

## Pull Requests

If you are familiar with git, you may prefer to make a pull request
with your proposed change/addition. We follow these guidelines:

We use the pull-request model, see [GitHub's help on
pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

In brief, you will:

* add an issue about what you plan to change;
* on GitHub, find and fork the source repository for `logothings`;
* on your computer, clone your forked repository,
* commit your changes in a new branch;
* push your branch and submit a pull-request for it;
* go through the review process until your pull-request is merged; and
* close your issue
